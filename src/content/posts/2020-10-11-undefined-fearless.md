All the atmosphere was calm Stephen don't know what will be happening he was confusion about Alaya's words. Finally, Alaya came near to Stephen and start talking about the past of their ancestors. " Stephen is the son of our King "Jordan " and his wife Rasika and his son Stephen who was a baby He was a good-hearted king, he always spend with animals and also know their languages mostly he loves his childhood friend Saliya which was snake. She is the queen of the "Jordan forest" top of the head Which contains a precious diamond stone. One fine day King Jordan was meeting with ministers and they are planning about kingdom development. which is useful to all peoples who were living in a kingdom. At that time one minister whose name is Michelle who was living beside the forest. Michelle said dear magistry in my place all the people were worried about the forest snakes they are coming to our houses and they start leaving with us for reasons. We are all worried about this situation children so scary about the snake. And one snake bites to my neighbor's son who was died and also biting all the people in a kingdom So my magistry please save us my lord with fear of their snakes. Jordan said don't worry about the snake I will handle it and also my promise.

After the ministers meeting the King take a bed with his wife and starts a conversation with each other. Rasika asked Jordan what was the meeting today. Jordan said everything is good but the problem is about the snakes are bites all the people's in a kingdom. Jordan doesn't know how to talk Saliya and how she reacts about these problem. Rasika said don't worry about Saliya she is your friend and she understands your situation. Go and talk to her. The next day Jordan entered a "Jordan forest" the queen of snake Saliya received him. Jordan starts a conversation about Saliya. the king explains about all the problems we're facing the people about snakes. the Saliya listen to all the conversation and said it's impossible to us and we don't stop the bitting to people's why because we don't have respect all are playing with us and also killing us mostly the people's kills all my snakes who were did proper work. No one can be treated as a good all are were punished and killing us it impossible my mystery. We can't do that. After the listen of Sailya conversation okay I can understand your problem give us a chance I will explain all peoples in a kingdom don't kill any snake in a forest I will handle it. But the she said I don't do that because you are also a human we can't trust the people's. Jordan said you're my childhood friend why you don't understand me. Saliya said I can understand your problem but this matter I will don't agree you hope you understand. Jordan said no will give a promise to the kingdom people's will don't take my words back I will stop all the snake not to bite and not to go people's houses.

Saliya said it's impossible I am the queen of the Jordan forest she feels proud at that time the top of the diamond ring was shining and they also have a magic power. Jordan said Saliya will start a rash conversation each and other at that time Saliya sister Alaya entered between the conversation both Saliya and Alaya were arguing with King Jordon. Finally the King was left to the house. Aaliya said to Saliya your friend is so rude I will kill him. Saliya was thinking about the Jordan why we both doing argue with each and other. Saliya calls to Alaya we did a wrong and don't want to argue with a king. Aaliya said we did a good because we need our priority and we don't want to be dependent we need our kingdom and need our future good. if there are Peoples we don't have any name and we don't have value in a kingdom. So we want to kill all the people's in a kingdom and we rule the snake's Kingdom. Alaya washed the mind of Saliya.

Jordan was thinking about the future of the kingdom and if the problem continued no one can have in a kingdom so we want to do anything to save a kingdom Alaya speaks all the snakes to kill all the people's in a kingdom we handled the kingdom. All the snakes were getting ready to fight with Peoples but King Jordan doesn't know that. Saliya entered in a king's port Jordan saw to Saliya and came near to the Saliya.
